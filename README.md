# Hello World!! I'm Rinka.
 
I'm a very very passionate developer from Chennai, a city in the southern part India.

Art has always captivated me. Poems, quotes , paintings and anything that involves a lot of creativity!

“You might not think that programmers are artists, but programming is an extremely creative profession. It's logic-based creativity.” - John Romero

Different people will have different reasons as to why they love being a developer. Getting to be creative and try something new and to come up with new and different solutions everyday is why I love being one.

When I'm not solving problems or battling bugs, you can find me spending time in nature, singing loudly along to music or having long talks with people.
